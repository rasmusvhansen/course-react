# Danske Bank Brabrand React Introduction Course

This is the material for a one day course introducing the basics of developing a modern React application.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.danskenet.net/bd3170/react-course`

   1. If you have issues cloning and it requires authentication, try creating a PAT (personal access token) in github. By going to settings / Developer settings / Personal access tokens and use that as password. See https://confluence.danskenet.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=876275948

1. `cd react-course`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

The task at hand is to build a Movie Search application. A good starting point is to look inside `MovieSearch.tsx`

## Slides

Slides with links etc. can be found in `slides/index.html` just open the file in a browser and it should work.

## Cheatsheet

The react docs are awesome, take a look at them: https://react.dev/learn

For TypeScript specific gotchas I have created a short [cheatsheet](./CHEATSHEET.md)
